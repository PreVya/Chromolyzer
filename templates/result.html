          Individuals who exhibit high levels of emotional resilience are characterized as being emotionally adept, even-tempered. They tend to
          navigate through life experiencing fewer negative emotions and demonstrating a superior ability to cope with stress and adversity.
          Furthermore, they are more inclined to express positive emotions, such as enthusiasm. On the flip side, individuals with lower levels of
          emotional resilience may be more susceptible to negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and anger. They may find themselves reacting
          more strongly to stress and facing challenges with greater difficulty. Additionally, they may engage in various maladaptive behaviors,
          including substance abuse or self-harm. Studies indicate that emotional resilience is linked to various outcomes, encompassing mental
          health, physical well-being, and interpersonal relationships. Moreover, people with heightened emotional resilience, may enjoy better
          physical health, evidenced by reduced rates of cardiovascular disease. Average emotional resilience scorers tend to be subjective with
          experiences and express emotions accordingly.

        <p>{{deci_per}}</p>
        <p class="leading-8">
          Individuals who excel in decisive or decision-making skills are characterized as being reliable, hardworking, and efficient. They tend to be
          well-organized and responsible, with a strong motivation to achieve their goals. Additionally, they may exhibit a profound sense of
          self-discipline and perseverance in their pursuits. On the other hand, individuals who struggle with decisive or decision-making skills may
          be more impulsive and disorganized. They might encounter challenges in setting and achieving goals, and they could be prone to engaging in
          behaviors that are not conducive to their best interests. Research has demonstrated that decisiveness or decision-making ability is linked
          to a range of outcomes, including academic and job performance, and longevity. High aptitude for decisive decision-making tend to exhibit
          better academic and job performance. It is important to note that excessively high levels of decisiveness or decision-making skills can also
          have negative consequences, such as being overly perfectionistic or rigid. Medium scores for decision-making suggest a balanced and adaptive
          approach to the process of making choices. Individuals with moderate decision-making scores may demonstrate a blend of thoughtful
          consideration and a willingness to take risks when appropriate.

        <p>{{social_incli}}</p>
        <p class="leading-8">
          Social Inclination is typically characterized by an individual's tendency to seek out social interaction and stimulation, as well as their
          level of enthusiasm and assertiveness in social situations. Individuals who score high on this dimension tend to be outgoing, sociable, and
          talkative. They enjoy being around others and seek out social situations. They are often described as having a high level of energy,
          enthusiasm, and assertiveness. They may also be more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors, such as partying, drinking, or other forms
          of excitement-seeking. In contrast, individuals who score low on social inclination are more introverted and reserved. They may prefer to
          spend time alone or in small groups, and may feel uncomfortable in large social gatherings. They may also be less assertive and more
          cautious in their interactions with others. The average scorers can be classified into selectively extroverted people. They possess the
          ability to navigate between outgoing sociability and a preference for more solitary pursuits based on the context and their personal
          preferences.

        <p>{{social_well_per}}</p>
        <p class="leading-8">
          Individuals who score high on social wellbeing are characterized as being warm, kind, and considerate. They tend to be cooperative and are
          motivated to maintain harmonious social relationships. Moreover, they may possess a strong sense of empathy and concern for the welfare of
          others. On the contrary, individuals who score low on social wellbeing tend to be more competitive and skeptical. They may be less motivated
          to maintain social harmony and may be more inclined to express their opinions forcefully, even if they may conflict with others. Research
          has shown that social wellbeing is linked to a range of outcomes, including interpersonal relationships, job performance, and mental health.
          For instance, individuals who score high on social wellbeing tend to have more positive and supportive relationships with others. They may
          also excel in careers that require teamwork and collaboration. However, it is important to note that excessively high levels of social
          wellbeing can also have negative consequences, such as being overly compliant or lacking assertiveness. Medium scores for social wellbeing
          may reflect a balanced and adaptable approach to interpersonal relationships. Individuals with moderate levels of social wellbeing may
          possess a combination of warmth, kindness, and cooperation, while also maintaining a healthy degree of assertiveness and independence. Those
          with medium scores on social wellbeing might engage in cooperative behaviors when needed, contributing to harmonious relationships, yet they
          may also express their opinions and needs with a reasonable level of assertiveness. In short this possesses well-rounded and adaptable
          social orientation.

        <p>{{curiosity_per}}</p>
        <p class="leading-8">
          Individuals with a high curiosity quotient are characterized as being imaginative, curious, and open to new ideas and experiences. They tend
          to be intellectually curious and enjoy exploring new concepts and ideas. Moreover, they may exhibit a preference for creativity and
          aesthetics. On the other hand, individuals with a low curiosity quotient tend to be more traditional and conservative. They may have a
          preference for familiar and predictable experiences and may be less likely to seek out novel experiences. Research has shown that curiosity
          quotient is linked to a range of outcomes, including creativity, innovation, and cultural competence. These people may face challenges as
          they may be overly impulsive or having difficulty with routine tasks. Individuals with a low curiosity quotient may exhibit a preference for
          familiarity and routine, often leaning towards more traditional and conservative perspectives. Their comfort zone may center around
          predictable experiences, and they might be less inclined to seek out or embrace novel ideas and unfamiliar situations. While this can
          provide a sense of stability, it may also limit their exposure to new possibilities, hindering potential personal growth and inhibiting
          adaptability to change. individuals with medium curiosity quotient scores strike a balance between openness to new experiences and a
          preference for familiarity. They may tend to seek knowledge on arenas they are interested in. They might be open to exploring new ideas and
          experiences within certain limits, fostering adaptability without being overwhelmed by constant novelty.
